        Steven George Gerrard MBE (born 30 May 1980) is an English professional football manager and former player, who manages Premier League club Aston Villa. 
        Described by pundits and fellow professionals as one of his generation's greatest players, Gerrard spent the majority of his playing career as a central midfielder for Liverpool 
        and the England national team, captaining both.
        Gerrard began his managerial career managing the Liverpool Youth Academy's under-18 team. His senior managerial career began in 2018 with Scottish Premiership club Rangers. 
        In his third full season in charge, Gerrard's side went unbeaten in the league to win Rangers' first league title in 10 years. 
        In November 2021, he became the manager of Aston Villa. 
        On 22 March, Gerrard was sent off 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute in a match against Manchester United for stamping on Ander Herrera.
        Gerrard made his 500th league appearance for Liverpool in a goalless draw against West Brom on 25 April; he became only the third player ever to achieve 500 or more Premier League appearances for one club, after Ryan Giggs and former teammate Jamie Carragher.His final appearance for Liverpool at Anfield was on 16 May against Crystal Palace in a 3–1 loss. 
        His final appearance for the club was eight days later in a 6–1 defeat at Stoke, with Gerrard scoring Liverpool's only goal of the game.
